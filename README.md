# Browser-Analysis

This project was created to analyze memory usuage of Chrome and Edge on my personal computer. This came about as I was working on Android studios and I had 90% usuage of RAM (12GB)

### Memory Tracker
This program will be tracking memory usuage and will write this to a text file.
In the current implementation to exit the program just enter "CTRL X" which will kill the process. In the future plan to use timers to schedule when this program should be running.

### Memory Graph
This program will create a graph from the previous text file.
